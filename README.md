# xwbserver
-------------------

A Linux web server implementation. I plan on using this as a reference for a
couple of tutorials on implementing the HTTP protocol on actual code.

Future Features:
- thread-per-connection
- support for dynamic content
- handle better permissions
- support for more HTTP methods.

As of Feb 1, 2016
- supports static web pages.
- supports GET method.
- supports some basic error handling.
